As tradition dictates, all the cousins went to see Father Christmas.
This year, instead of visiting the winter wonderland at Chessington Garden Centre, we went to Denbies Wine Estate for a change. A different experience which consisted of a ‘train’ ride around the estate in a festive truck, followed by a meeting with the Old Boy Himself.
