It's time. I have finally got around to starting a blog, albeit a very stripped back basic one. 

I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build this from scratch, as opposed to popular blogging tools.

I'm learning, and whilst I'm trying to get this thing going, I'm going to make this first post short. I'll take more time in the next post to explain what Dawsneyland is.

This may be a bit rubbish, but I'm unwilling to delete this post - for the time being at least.

Until next time...

MD
