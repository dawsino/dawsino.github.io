<p>Dawsneyland has existed for a while now. Not for everyone, mind you - only for me, because it is all in my head.</p>
 
<p>It’s the place I live, the life I lead, the things I do, the people I love and the struggles I face. Starting this blog is an effort to organise the mish-mash of thoughts I have and share them with whoever feels they would like to read them. It’s not always the most interesting place in the world, so I’ll be selective, and hopefully make it interesting to read.</p>
